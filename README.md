This repository is no longer maintained. Issues with zthread exist due to providing an extracted copy. Use the tar.gz version and extract it in the Dockerfile in order to have it work properly. You also need to fix the configure script converting `[:space:]` to `[[:space:]]`.

The docker hub repository will continue to be updated. This is now managed in a private repository with proper CI/CD to automate builds and deployments.
